<p>Problem: <em>A gym that has started to launch its clothing brand, needs to better market its products to its customers and anyone else interested in them, and at the same time they need to expedite orders and deliveries of products purchased by customers.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Giving a Solution:&nbsp;<em>It has been proposed to develop a mobile application, this because the mobile application is quick and easy access for customers, this application will basically consist of a delivery, as it meets most of the customer needs, this will have on hand and in sight all the products, you can place an order for any product found there, and in turn track that product.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p>Justification:<em> This project is worth doing because it will bring the gym into the new technologies, taking full advantage of them so that their customers can feel more satisfied with the service and products, and for the gym will be much easier to handle certain functions that are performed in a somewhat archaic way.&nbsp;<br /></em></p>
<p>End User: <em>This project is aimed at all gym users and anyone interested in acquiring non-gym products.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Utility:<em>As in this project there will not be any investment of cost, there will only be an investment of time and the return on investment will be the grades we will get for our project.&nbsp;</em></p>
